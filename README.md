# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles 

## Running the script
To install the environment simply run:
```shell
make
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## Tmux extensions
These can be installed by opening Tmux and running Ctrl + Space(The prefix key) followed by I(capital i).

## Font of choice
The Font I use and that works together with the catppuccin theme can be found here: [Nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). Look for JetBrainsMono Nerd Font!

## Largely inspired by
[Andreas Bauer's dotfiles](https://github.com/andreas-bauer/dotfiles)
